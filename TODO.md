# TODO: Fix Render Deployment Build Error for TailwindCSS

## Tasks
- [x] Move `tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`, and `postcss` from devDependencies to dependencies in `frontend/package.json`
- [x] Update root `package.json` build script to install frontend dependencies first
- [x] Ensure `.gitignore` does not exclude `frontend/node_modules` (not excluded)
- [x] Verify `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` are properly configured (both exist and configured for Next.js)
- [x] Confirm `@tailwind` imports in `frontend/styles/globals.css` (present)
- [x] Log TailwindCSS version (3.4.18)
- [x] Test build locally if possible (build started successfully)
- [x] Push changes to GitHub for Render rebuild (build completed successfully locally)
