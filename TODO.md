# TODO: Fix Render Deployment ENOENT Error

- [x] Remove static file serving code from backend/server.js that serves from "../frontend/out".

- [x] Ensure API routes under /api prefix still work.
- [x] Add logging for successful startup of both Express and Next.js.
- [x] Update production start script if needed.
